# Edge AI Deployment System Architecture

## System Overview
The Edge AI Deployment System is designed as a modular, extensible platform for deploying and managing AI models on edge devices.

## Core Components

### 1. Model Optimization Engine
- **Quantization**: INT8/FP16 conversion for reduced memory footprint
- **Graph Optimization**: Operation fusion and dead code elimination
- **Hardware Compilation**: Device-specific optimizations

### 2. Runtime Executor
- **Multi-backend Support**: ONNX, TensorFlow Lite, OpenVINO
- **Memory Management**: Efficient buffer allocation and reuse
- **Performance Profiling**: Real-time latency and throughput monitoring

### 3. Fleet Management
- **Remote Monitoring**: Device health and model performance metrics
- **OTA Updates**: Secure model deployment and rollback
- **Telemetry Collection**: Centralized logging and analytics

## Supported Platforms
- Raspberry Pi (3B+, 4, Zero 2W)
